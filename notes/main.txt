Useful tips for node-mysql

OPTIONS

1) Node/Express as backend (node-mysql to connect to db).  Then Jade or http://handlebarsjs.com/ as templating engine?  Would need mailgun as email provider (possibly around $200-300/month). Security?  Does node handle cookies?  I think so, but if not, would need to go jwt
    -Next steps for this version (nord-enterprises-node)
        a) github repo
        b) basic express routing
            -be sure to test multiple sites: not sure where to make connection and end connection- currently just opening connection on server start and leaving open, but might need to refine that.
            -get url, if home-owners-assoc, next item is sitename- if not, first item is sitename.  Set up basic root route and see if you can get the proper info.
            -set up basic page return with info from db (homepage for zaplake- use templating engine?)
            -get page edit functionality (new admin panel)- will need login/auth!



2) Python/Django as backend.  Includes templating, password (would it work with existing db?) and mail functions (could integrate with more 'real' option like mailgun later).
    -Next steps for this version (no folder yet)
        a) create folder
        b) set up latest version of Django (may have to update desktop and laptop)
        c) start dev server and try to set up homepage routing (use urls.py for regex routes)
