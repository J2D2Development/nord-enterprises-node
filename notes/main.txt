Useful tips for node-mysql
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5818312/mysql-with-node-js

OPTIONS

1) Node/Express as backend (node-mysql to connect to db).  Then Jade or http://handlebarsjs.com/ as templating engine?  Would need mailgun as email provider (possibly around $200-300/month). Security?  Does node handle cookies?  I think so, but if not, would need to go jwt
    -Next steps for this version (nord-enterprises-node)
        a) basic page structure
            -get hoa_main- save proper vars in session (get from old codebase)
            -get hoa_lookfeel- apply
            -set up html structure using ejs templates and includes
        b) login with sessions
        c) css templating: how?
            -if not possible, set up ejs file with just style type=text/css tags, then use ejs vars within that?  Include that in the 'head'?
        d) minify and concatenate all css/js files?  set up webpack maybe or just use gulp?

        Use for sessions:

            for production stores: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-mysql-session




2) Python/Django as backend.  Includes templating, password (would it work with existing db?) and mail functions (could integrate with more 'real' option like mailgun later).
    -Next steps for this version (no folder yet)
        a) create folder
        b) set up latest version of Django (may have to update desktop and laptop)
        c) start dev server and try to set up homepage routing (use urls.py for regex routes)
